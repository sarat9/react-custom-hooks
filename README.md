#### Things To take care while creating Hooks!
-  **Handle Memory Leaks** : The memory leak will happen if the API server or host took some time to respond and the component was unmounted before the response was received. Though the component was unmounted, the response to the request will still be received on completion. The response will then be parsed and setData will be called.
